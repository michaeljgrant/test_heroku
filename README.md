# GA Second Project
### Second Project for General Assembly SEI-ANZ-SEIFXR05

Build a full-stack database-backed application.
Requirements:
Your app must:
* Have at least 2 tables (more if they make sense) â€“ one of them should represent the people using your application (users).
* Include sign up/log in functionality (if it makes sense), with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* Modify data in the database There should be ways for users to add/change some data in the database (it's ok if only admins can make changes).
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Project Outline
### Message board for bread enthusiasts.

Create a messageboard where people can post about bread; such as bakeries, recipes and tips and tricks for creating the perfect bread.

This idea is a parody of reddit called breaddit - and will have common messageboard functionality - post, delete, like, dislike and comment and photos.

The website will require users to create an account and login to access the functionality.
